# HamLib Simulation - Benchmark Program

Simulation of quantum systems is one of the most promising applications for quantum computers [[1]](#references). In the current version of this benchmark, we have three strategies for calculating fidelities. 

In the first strategy, we compare the quantum simulation against a classical circuit simulation to report our fidelity. This works well for small circuit sizes but is not scalable past a certain number of qubits. 

In the second strategy, we compare the quantum simulation against a classical simulation of the exact Hamiltonian dynamics to report our fidelity. Again, this is not scalable.

In the third strategy, we use the mirror circuits method developed by Sandia Laboratories [[2]](#references). This technique constructs a mirror circuit, which is a base circuit followed by a reverse circuit. It produces an easy to verify correct distribution. This is scalable to all qubit sizes. 

This benchmark is a more advanced version of the existing Hamiltonian Simulation Benchmark. It offers the user several Hamiltonians to simulate from Hamlib [3](#references), a comprehensive dataset of qubit-based Hamiltonians. It also offers a more sophisticated version of the mirror circuits method that uses techniques such as a random Pauli layer and random initial state to reduce unintentional error effects from the circuit mirroring.  

## Problem outline

This benchmark is written as a simulation of non-trivial Hamiltonians from Hamlib. It currently supports the following Hamiltonians: The Fermi-Hubbard Model, the Bose-Hubbard Model, the Heisenberg Model, the Transverse Field Ising Model, and the Max3Sat problem. However, it can be easily generalized to benchmark any of the other Hamiltonians classes from Hamlib. 

The benchmark evolves an initial state according to a Hamiltonian $H$. The benchmark has two possible initial states, the checkerboard state $|\psi(0)\rangle\equiv|010101\ldots\rangle$ or the GHZ state  $|\psi(0)\rangle = \left| \text{GHZ} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |0\rangle^{\otimes n} + |1\rangle^{\otimes n} \right)$, where $n$ is equivalently the number of spins or qubits. In either case, we aim to evolve the system for $t$ time according to the solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation with $H$ constant,

$$
|\psi(t)\rangle=e^{-i{H}t}|\psi(0)\rangle
$$

where we set <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}\hbar=1"> here and elsewhere.

# Fermi-Hubbard Model

The Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian \cite{hubbard1964electron} models the dynamics of fermions on lattice sites and is given by
\[
H_{FH} = -t \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle, \sigma} (c_{i,\sigma}^\dagger c_{j,\sigma} + c_{j,\sigma}^\dagger c_{i,\sigma}) + U \sum_i n_{i,\uparrow} n_{i,\downarrow},
\]
where \(\langle i, j \rangle\) denotes adjacent lattice sites \(i\) and \(j\), \(\sigma\) represents the fermion spin, \(c\) and \(c^\dagger\) are the fermionic annihilation and creation operators, respectively, and \(n_{j,\sigma} = c_{j,\sigma}^\dagger c_{j,\sigma}\) is the number operator. The first term of the Hamiltonian describes the tunneling of fermions between adjacent sites with amplitude \(t\), representing the noninteracting dynamics, while the second term captures the on-site fermion interaction with strength \(U\).

For our benchmarks, we only use the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model but allow varying $U$ and $t$. 

### Heisenberg Model

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}H=J\sum_{i=0}^{N-2}(\sigma^x_i\sigma^x_{i+1}+\sigma^y_i\sigma^y_{i+1}+\sigma^z_i\sigma^z_{i+1})+w\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}(h_{x,i}\sigma^x_i+h_{z,i}\sigma^z_i)"/>
</p>

Where <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}J"/> is the strength of the interaction, <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}w"/> is the strength of the disordered fields, <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}h_{x,i}"/> and <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}h_{z,i}"/> give the strength of the x and z disorded fields at site <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}i"/>, and <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}\sigma^{\{x,y,z\}}_i"/> are the usual Pauli operators acting on site <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}i"/>. We will use the notation <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}\{X_i,Y_i,Z_i\}\equiv\sigma^{\{x,y,z\}}_i"/> interchangably throughout this explanation.

The first sum represents the **interaction terms**, whereas the second represents the **disordered field terms** (see Fig 1.)

In our benchmarks, currently both $J=1$ and $w=1$.

### Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)

The TFIM Hamiltonian is given by:

$$
H= J\sum_{i=0}^{N-2}\sigma^z_i\sigma^z_{i+1} + h\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\sigma^x_i
$$

Where <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}J"/> is the coupling strength between neighboring spins, and <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}h"/> is the strength of the transverse field.

In our benchmarks, currently both $J=1$ and $h=1$.

## Benchmarking
The Hamiltonian Simulation algorithm is benchmarked by running **just a single circuit**. This circuit is repeated a number of times denoted by `num_shots`. We then run the algorithm circuit for numbers of qubits between `min_qubits` and `max_qubits`, inclusive. The test returns the averages of the circuit creation times, average execution times, fidelities, and circuit depths, like all of the other algorithms. 

There are currently three methods for how to produce the fidelity metric. All three methods evolve a state and create a metric based on how well the state evolved. 

In all three methods, by default, we set the trotterization steps (k) to 5 and the total time to 1, but these can be set to different values at the user's discretion.  

The first two methods evolve an initial state a time $t$ and compare the final state against a correct distribution. Method = 1 creates the correct distribution from a noiseless simulation of the Hamiltonian Simulation quantum circuit. Method = 2 creates a correct distribution from a classical matrix technique to simulate the evolution of the Hamiltonian directly. Whereas method = 1 only tests the performance of the hardware, method = 2 also tests the accuracy of the Hamiltonian simulation itself. 

These correct distributions are created on-the-fly as the benchmarks are run. (This is unlike the Hamiltonian Simulation Benchmark, which uses precalculated distributions.) This is a less than ideal fidelity calculation as it does not scale to any size of qubits. It requires the classical simulation of matrix products, which requires resources exponential in the number of qubits. 

Method = 3 uses a mirror circuit built using the Hamiltonian Simulation circuit, designed so that the correct distribution is trivial. It applies first the circuit, then the reverse of the circuit, so that the final state should be the (trivial) initial state. There are additional options to use a layer of random Paulis in the middle and/or a random initial state to increase generality and resistance to unintentional error effects from the structure of mirroring. This method scales to any size of qubits, since the correct distribution is easy to calculate.  

In all cases, we compare the resultant distribution using our [noise-normalized fidelity calculation](../_doc/POLARIZATION_FIDELITY.md).

## Classical algorithm

Much effort has been made in the field of many-body physics to understand the approximate behaviors of Hamiltonians like the ones we have here. However, to calculate the evolution of an excited state through exact diagonalization scales approximately as <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}O(2^{3n})"> for <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}n"> qubits, quite poor scaling [[2]](#references). This quickly becomes intractable even utilizing extremely powerful classical supercomputers.

## Quantum algorithm

To run this algorithm on our quantum computer, we need to find a way to apply the unitary <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}U(t)\equiv{e}^{-i{H}t}"/> through a combination of quantum gates. In order to approximate this operator, we use Trotterization [[3]](#references), where we note that Lie product formula gives

<p align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}e^{-i{\sum_j{H}_j}t}=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\left(\prod_j{e}^{-iH_j{t}/k}\right)^k"/>.
</p>

If we take <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}k"/> to be finite, this is called Trotterization. This has a gate complexity of <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}O(n^5)"/>, which is an exponential speedup. We can then apply successive layers by exponentiating the individual terms in the Hamiltonian to approximate the evolution of any state. This makes the simulation easier, as it is much easier to calculate the gates which apply <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}e^{i\theta\sigma^x_0\sigma^x_1}"/> and <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}e^{i\theta\sigma^x_1\sigma^x_2}"/> than to find the gates which apply <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}e^{i\theta(\sigma^x_0\sigma^x_1+\sigma^x_1\sigma^x_2)}"/>. This process can be visualized in the circuit diagram below for the **Heisenberg Hamiltonian** with a single step.

### General Quantum Circuit

</p>

*Fig 1. Example of circuit with 1 Trotter step. We can see that our <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}\sigma^x_i"/> and <img align=center src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\pagecolor{white}\sigma^y_i"/> turned into Rx and Ry gates, while the two qubit interactions turned into the gates that result from exponentiating these terms in the Hamiltonian. Note that this circuit application is less efficient than applying the XX, YY, and ZZ operations all at once.*

### Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize qubits in either Checkerboard or GHZ state.

2. Build the Trotter step layer.
   
3. Apply the Hamiltonian as Trotter step layers for as many Trotter steps were chosen.

4. Check if method == 3. If True, apply mirror circuit.

5. Measure out all of the qubits

6. Compare the measured distribution with the distribution from specific methods.

7. Get the metrics like fidelity, circuit depth, time of execution, etc.

## Mirror Circuit Method:

The primary goal of the mirror circuit is to create a scalable benchmarks for the Hamiltonian Simulation circuits. There are several options for how the mirror circuits are constructed. By default, a mirror circuit consists of an initial state, the trotterized Hamiltonian simulation circuit, then the inverse of the trotterized circuit. In this case, the correct distribution is simply the starting state. 

The first option to consider is to apply a randomized pauli layer in the center of the circuit. method that applies a Quasi Hamiltonian $\widetilde{H}$ instead of an Inverse Hamiltonian. After the hamiltonian is applied, a layer of random pauli gates $P_{random}$ is applied, and then the $\widetilde{H}$ is applied such that the overall circuit becomes a Resultant Pauli Operator $P_{resultant}$ applied over the initial state $Init$, i.e. $\widetilde{H} P_{random} H Init = P_{resultant} Init$.
